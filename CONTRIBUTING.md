# Contributing

Before contributing or comment, please note that I am not a professional infosec or pen tester. I am just a student who want to learn and teach to others. Other contributors might be students as well, so be patient and indulgent with everyone. Do not forget that the main goal here is to write about ethical hacking and teach to others. Tools that are just about malicious hacking and not useful for a professional pen tester will not be added to the README.

**Please don't open an issue to get help with a tool.**

We learn ethical hacking here, for discussions about hacking in general please refers to the *[#discussions](https://github.com/sundowndev/hacker-roadmap#discussions)* section in the README.

### Before submitting a new tool

Please don't submit unverified or untested tools. We only want to share tools that have good community of contributors. If you've created a tool, be sure the code is stable and will be maintained.

Thank you for sharing and contributing ! :tada:
